# smart-dustbin-iot
smart dustbin project using arduiono UNO
The main concept behind the Smart Dustbin using Arduino project is Object Detection
A simple methodology is implemented here, where the Ultrasonic Sensor is placed on top of the dustbinâ€™s lid and when the sensor detects any object like a human hand, it will trigger Arduino to open the lid.
